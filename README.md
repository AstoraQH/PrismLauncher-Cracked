### Development Builds

Please understand that these builds are not intended for most users. There may be bugs, and other instabilities. You have been warned.

There are development builds available through:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/AstoraQH/PrismLauncher-Cracked/actions) (includes builds from pull requests opened by contribuitors)
- [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/AstoraQH/PrismLauncher-Cracked/workflows/trigger_builds/develop) (this will always point only to the latest version of develop)

These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.
